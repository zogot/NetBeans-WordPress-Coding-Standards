## NetBeans WordPress Coding Standards
#### By Leon Rowland | http://leon.rowland.nl

### Description

NetBeans settings for following the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/).

As NetBeans doesn't properly support exporting formatting settings of sub categories ( PHP, JavaScript etc ) I have added those settings separately.  You can download the NetBeans-WordPress-Coding-Standards.zip file and choose Import to correctly get the PHP, JavaScript and CSS Coding Standards as defined in the WordPress Handbook.
The few aspects that the formatting doesn't correctly account for:

##### JavaScript:
* Spaces before variables inside callbacks but not functions.

### Installation

Download the NetBeans-WordPress-Coding-Standards.zip file, go to Netbeans > Preferences, choose Import and choose the newly downloaded zip file.

### Notes

Thanks to the [NetBeans-Settings-for-Laravel4 by myjxn](https://github.com/mrjxn/NetBeans-Settings-For-Laravel4) for the idea of setting mine up for WordPress.
